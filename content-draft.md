Stuff I want in my README.md
============================

## Projects (larger boxes: ([repo] +) Language/Tech + Description (+ Image))
SpeechSurfer (https://get.speechsurfer.com)
Elaris (https://gist.github.com/aliciusschroeder/4841942d076824b6ab53c70cf1bc1a23)
https://github.com/aliciusschroeder/SWCNN-watermark-removal (rework of the original project)
https://github.com/aliciusschroeder/spintax-editor
https://github.com/aliciusschroeder/pillcurve
https://github.com/aliciusschroeder/cf-geoip
https://github.com/aliciusschroeder/json_segments
https://github.com/aliciusschroeder/LeagueOfPredictions
https://github.com/aliciusschroeder/localgen-ui
https://github.com/aliciusschroeder/hey_automation

_Notes:_
- SWCNN appears twice, my contributions are some fixes to the original project. The rework includes many improvements on top of that [see SWCNN.txt](/project-descriptions/SWCNN.txt).
- The projects above are ordered by complexity/remarkability and description length/presentation should represent that.

## Contributions (small boxes: [owner]/[repo] + Language/Tech + Short Description)
https://github.com/jimmc414/onefilellm
https://github.com/Kiln-AI/Kiln
https://github.com/moinulmoin/chadnext

## Other Elements
- [ ] Fancy 3D activity display as generated by [GitHub Readme Stats](.github/workflows/profile-3d.yml)
- [ ] Display of my 5 most used languages (https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=aliciusschroeder)

## Other considerations
- When it comes to projects I want to display a clear hierarchy of my work with largest projects (SpeechSurfer, Elaris) > medium projects > contributions.
- I'm passionate about analytics, automation, IoT and humans
- Maybe inlcude socials? https://www.linkedin.com/in/alicius/ https://www.instagram.com/aliciusschroeder/
- Should showcase my techstack just by aligning the respective icons beautifully next to each other, no need of text for this. But a categorization of the icons would be nice, e.g. "Languages", "Frameworks", "Databases", "CI/CD", "Tools" etc.

## What I don't like/want
- No "ratings"
- No pseudo achievements like followers, stars, etc.
- No "GitHub streaks" or similar
- no todoist integration
