# Creating a GitHub Markdown profile README

The end goal of all of your tasks is to create a compelling README.md file for my ([aliciusschroeder](https://github.com/aliciusschroeder)) profile. It should primarily showcase what I'm most experienced with and the huge variety of projects I have worked on.

## Repository Structure

```
/aliciusschroeder
├── .github
│   └── workflows         # GitHub Actions workflow for generating a 3D activity display
├── github-info/          # Contains information about ways to style the README.md
├── project-descriptions/ # Contains detailed descriptions of my projects
├── README.md             # The main profile README file you'll create / edit
└── content-draft.md      # A draft file for content ideas and some of my notes/thoughts
```

## Technical and Stylistic Guidelines

- Use [Github Flavored Markdown](/github-info/gh-flavored-markdown.md) to the fullest 
- Use emojis very sparingly
- Strike the perfect balance between detail and brevity
- Target audience are technical recruiters (and sometimes non-technical recruiters), so the main objective is showcasing my value for their company as a Full Stack Developer.
